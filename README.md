# biometric-face-swap-benchmark

This repository aggregates verified executions of publicly available
face-swapping models and provides original preprocessing scripts for
biometric evaluation. All third-party models are included without
modification unless explicitly stated and are referenced to their
original repositories. Any future changes or fixes will be clearly
documented.

## Data Preprocessing Scripts
This folder contains all **original preprocessing scripts**
used for dataset curation, best-frame selection, and pair construction.
